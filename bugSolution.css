This solution involves ensuring that the custom directive is properly defined and applied, potentially addressing order of operations issues:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
@layer components {
  .my-custom-directive {
    @apply text-blue-500; /* ... other styles */
  }
}

.my-element {
  @apply my-custom-directive; 
}

/*Alternatively, a more explicit approach that may be more reliable*/
.my-element {
    text-blue-500; /* ... other styles */
}

```

This revised approach directly applies the styles to `.my-element`, bypassing the potential issues with the custom directive. Using this method can provide more explicit control and improve reliability.
