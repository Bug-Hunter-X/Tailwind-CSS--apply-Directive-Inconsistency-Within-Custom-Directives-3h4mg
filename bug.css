This bug arises when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive within a custom directive.  The `@apply` directive might not correctly apply the styles if the custom directive is not structured properly, leading to unexpected visual inconsistencies.

Example of buggy code (bug.css):

```css
@layer components {
  .my-custom-directive {
    @apply text-blue-500;
    /* Other styles... */
  }
}

/* ... elsewhere in your CSS ... */
.my-element {
  @apply my-custom-directive;
}
```

The above code might sometimes fail to apply `text-blue-500` to `.my-element`.
